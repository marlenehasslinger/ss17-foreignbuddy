### Notes for iOS Application

- For Testing the app please follow the registration process in the app. There is no specific "Test User" provided.

- Test Implementation was too complicated since we use Firebase as our backend system.

- We don't provide a functionality yet that limits the distance within matches are displayed because obviously the app doesn't have enough users for this constraint

- The hobbies which can be selected in the Settings of users profile are not used for the matching algorithm yet. They are used in our corresponding Android app.

- After compiling there sometimes is a parlellism issue when the profile photo URL is retrieved from the database. This error doesn't alawys occur, so in case it occurs while testing the application please compile again until the error doesnt occur.
