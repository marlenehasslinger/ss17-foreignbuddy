### Notes

- For Testing the app please follow the registration process in the app. There is no specific "Test User" provided.

- Test Implementation with Espresso using Firebase Data was to complicated to make it work in given time. So we only tested offline methods

- We commented out the functionality for limiting the distance within matches are displayed because obviously the app doesn't have enough users for constraints like this yet

- The hobbies which can be selected in the Settings of users profile are not used yet. They will be used later when we progress this app for our semester project. So just ignore them.
